# Bendy Ruler

This is a simple extension to measure paths with corners in them. \
It supports both square and hex grids, and all the measurement modes. \

### Usage

You can select the tool from the built-in "Measure" toolbar. \
Then click to start measuring, and click again to add a corner. \
When done either click âœ… to keep the measurement, or ðŸ—‘ / ESC to cancel.

Currently editing an existing ruler isn't supported, you need to delete and create a new one.
